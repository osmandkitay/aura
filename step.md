# AURA Protocol: Core Completion Tasks

This document outlines the essential tasks needed to complete AURA's foundation, following Aaron Swartz's philosophy of "show the concept, then let the community build." AURA already works as a protocol - these are the minimal tasks needed to make it ready for community growth.

## Essential Foundation Files (Must Complete)

### 1.1 Legal and Community Foundation
**Why**: Open source projects need proper legal foundation and community guidelines.
**Required Tasks**:
- [x] Create MIT LICENSE file in repository root
- [x] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with clear community guidelines  
- [x] Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for inclusive community
- [x] Add issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [x] Create pull request templates for contributions

### 1.2 Basic Documentation Completeness
**Why**: Core documentation gaps prevent community understanding.
**Required Tasks**:
- [x] Add missing schema generation documentation
- [x] Create simple deployment guide for reference server
- [x] Document the manifest validation process clearly
- [x] Add troubleshooting section for common setup issues

## Protocol Enhancement (Optional Improvements)

-

### 2.2 Reference Implementation Polish
**Why**: Small improvements make the reference implementation easier to understand.
**Optional Tasks**:
- [ ] Add more detailed comments explaining protocol concepts
- [ ] Create a simpler "minimal example" alongside the full reference
- [ ] Add Docker setup for easier experimentation

## Summary

AURA is essentially complete as a protocol specification and reference implementation. The core tasks above are the minimal requirements to make it ready for community adoption.

**What AURA Already Has:**
- ✅ Working protocol specification
- ✅ Complete TypeScript reference implementation
- ✅ JSON Schema validation
- ✅ CLI validation tool
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Clear documentation

**What's Missing (Essential):**
- LICENSE file and community guidelines
- Basic documentation gaps

**Everything Else:**
The community will build framework integrations, language bindings, tools, and examples organically. Aaron Swartz's philosophy was to show the concept and let people adapt it - which AURA already does perfectly.

**The protocol works. The reference implementation teaches. The community will build the ecosystem.**
